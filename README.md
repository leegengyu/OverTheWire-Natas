# OverTheWire-Natas
This repository contains a guide to completing the Natas levels in the OverTheWire wargames.  
Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

This repository serves as:
1) Documentation of the methods which I used and the thought process as I solve the Natas level challenges from OverTheWire wargames.
2) Revision guide based on the key takeaways from solving each challenge.

Each level of the walkthrough guide summarises the:
1) Level Goal (taken verbatim from each level's website)
2) Key Takeaways
3) Alternatives (if any)
4) Common misconceptions (if any)

# Walkthrough Guide
**Natas Level 0 → Level 1**  
You can find the password for the next level on this page.  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to view the page source using any methods.
* Since there is no visible sign of the password on the loaded page, the page source is the next thing we look to.
* To access the page source, right-click on anywhere on the page and select "View page source".
* Tip: CTRL + U is the shortcut key for Chrome web browsers.
* Password for Level 1: gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto

**Natas Level 1 → Level 2**  
You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!  
**Key Takeaways**: learn how to view the page source using any methods, besides rightclicking.
* The only difference between this level and the previous one is that the right-clicking function has been disabled, i.e. the menu which you see when you right-click no longer appears, and an alert box pops up to state so.
* Method 1: The tip I mentioned in the previous level came in handy here! Find out the shortcut key to view the page source on your web browser by opening another tab/window. (CTRL + U is the shortcut key for Chrome web browsers.)
* Method 2: Find out the shortcut key to inspect elements and expand several sections of the HTML code to find the password. This is a more tedious method than Method 1, but you can play with the elements just to get a feel of how HTML elements work. (CTRL + SHIFT + I is the shortcut key for Chrome web browsers.)
* Method 3: Find a browser extension that enables right-click.
* Password for Level 2: ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi
